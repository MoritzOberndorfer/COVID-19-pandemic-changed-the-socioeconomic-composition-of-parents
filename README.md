Hi,
Thanks for your interest in our paper and the related code. 
I appreciate that it is a lot of code and it might be difficult to navigate. I tried my best to describe what each chunck of code does next to the respective lines. 
If you want to see the code used for figures and the table in the main manuscript, go to the file Code_figure_34567_table1_160224.do. 
If you want to see the code used for everything that is in our supplementary material, go to the file Code_supplement_16022024.do
We could have reduced the amount of code needed by using some additional loops and macros for each country. However, we feel that this would have made it more difficult to follow our decisions in the analysis.

Additionally, we publish our data preparation code although we cannot make the data available in this repository. Where data are available, you can find the links in the code files.
Upon request, we can possibly share the aggregated time series data we created using our restricted individual-level data access for Finland, Austria, and the Netherlands.

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any issues finding parts of the code you are looking for. I'm happy to help. (moritz.oberndorfer@helsinki.fi)

Enjoy
